The match will be immediately halted and the opponent will be awarded a win.</li><li>Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the robots will be instructed by the organisers to release. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker wants to release but does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the robots separated by the safest means.</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>General Rules</h3>\r\n<ol><li>There will be three rounds of two and half  minutes each.</li><li>Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified.</li><li>In no case should the arena be damaged by any bot.

Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.</li><li>Violation of any of the above rules will lead to disqualification.</li><li>Decision of organizers will be final and binding on all.</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety Rules</h3>\r\nCompliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.\r\n<ol><li>Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics, robot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.</li><li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.</li><li>Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.</li><li>Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event coordinators.</li><li>All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.</li><li>All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing. Any kind of activity (repairing, battery handling, pneumatics systems etc.) which may cause damage to the surroundings during the stay of the teams in the competition area should not be carried out without the consent of organizers. Not following this rule may result in disqualification.</li><li>All the resources provided at the time of competition from the organizers should be strictly used only after the consent of the organizers.</li><li>Once the robots should enter into the arena, no team member can enter into the arena at any point of time. In case if a fight has to be halted in between and some changes have to be done in the arena or condition on the robot(s), it will be done by organizers only</li></ol>\r\n<b>NOTE: Qualification of a robot to next level is subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn’t guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to the next round.</b>",
