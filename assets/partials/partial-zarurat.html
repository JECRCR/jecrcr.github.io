                    <p>Zarurat - the help beyond is a social endeavor by the JECRC foundation which focuses on imparting a healthy all round development of the underprivileged children from the nearby slum areas. Keeping up with the spirit of Renaissance, the pre-Renaissance event “Zarurat - celebrating innocence” is celebrated, seeing a footfall of 350 kids from various NGOs and 200 student volunteers.</p>
                    <p>    The team is very fortunate to be blessed and mentored by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Shree Kailash Satyarthi Sir who has graced the previous year's event with his benign presence.</p>
                    <p>    Continuing the spirit of celebration, Zarurat will be organising this year's event on 17th March 2016. The event is proposed to witness the esteemed presence of Shri Anshu Gupta, founder Goonj Foundation, Shri Lenin Raghuvanshi, founder of People's Vigilance committee on Human Rights  and Ms. Gloria Benny, founder of Make a Difference.</p>
